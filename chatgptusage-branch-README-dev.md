# 🧠 How to Use `chat-edits` Workflow (for Jubair, in excruciating detail)

This file explains how to safely and clearly pull in ChatGPT-edited files into your newsletter GitHub repo — without messing up your main version.

---

## 👩‍🔬 Why This Exists

When you ask ChatGPT to patch or improve your `.ipynb` notebook, you’ll get a file like:

```
LET_v1.8_chat.ipynb
```

This is a fixed/improved version of your notebook. You **do not** want to:
- overwrite your `main` branch
- commit unreviewed changes
- lose your current progress

So instead, we isolate those changes into a branch called:

```
chat-edits
```

This way:
- You keep full control
- You can review the changes
- You can merge or reject them later

---

## 🛠 What You’ll Do

You’ll run a script that does the following:

1. Checks out a safe branch (`chat-edits`)
2. Replaces the old version of the notebook with the new one from ChatGPT
3. Saves it and uploads it to GitHub

---

## 🧾 Step-by-step instructions (every time ChatGPT gives you a file)

### 1. Place the file in your repo folder

If ChatGPT gives you `LET_v1.8_chat.ipynb`, download it and drop it into your main project folder — the same one where your `.git` folder lives.

If it's in `Downloads`, just move it to `D:/AI`.

---

### 2. Run the script

Make sure the script file exists:
```
apply_chat_edits.sh
```

If yes, open your terminal and run:

```bash
bash apply_chat_edits.sh
```

💡 You must have Git installed, and you must be inside your repo folder.

---

### 3. What the script does (in plain English)

- Switches you to the `chat-edits` branch (makes it if needed)
- Moves the patched file into `notebooks/LET_v1.8.ipynb`
- Saves the change with a clear Git commit
- Uploads it to GitHub for safekeeping

---

### 4. What you’ll see in GitHub

You’ll now have a branch called `chat-edits` with the edited notebook already in place. Go to GitHub and:
- View it online
- Create a pull request into `main` if you’re happy with it
- Delete the branch if you’re done with it

---

## 🧹 Clean Up (optional)

If you want to delete the `_chat.ipynb` file after applying:
```bash
rm LET_v1.8_chat.ipynb
```

If you want Git to never track files like this, add this line to `.gitignore`:

```
*_chat.ipynb
```

---

## 🔁 Repeat the Process

Whenever ChatGPT gives you a new version:
- Drop the file into the folder
- Run the script again
- Let Git do the rest

---

This keeps everything clean, controlled, and versioned — no manual overwriting, no accidents.
